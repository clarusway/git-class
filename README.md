Hello guys,

you can follow my githup account:  fatihtepe

Believe me you will not regret it!

I forked this repo then cloned to my local git. I think I am on track!!!

Still working on it..In Git, there are two main ways to integrate changes from one branch into another: the merge and the rebase.

Now I am in my experiment branch 8:39 a.m. added this note I can not see my github changes here yet!
