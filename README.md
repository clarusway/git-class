Hello guys,

you can follow my githup account:  fatihtepe

Believe me you will not regret it!

I forked this repo then cloned to my local git. I think I am on track!!!

Still working on it..In Git, there are two main ways to integrate changes from one branch into another: the merge and the rebase.

Now I am working on experiment branch..couple minutes ago I rebased main to experiment and working on experiment branch..

I will git checkout main then git merge experiment

then will check my github account try to find out changes..

8:37 am I did minor changes here..and now will go back to my experiment branch will do rebase
